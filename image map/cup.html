            Cups are an obvious improvement on using cupped hands or feet to hold liquids. As such, they have almost certainly been used since before recorded history, 
            and indeed, they have been found at archaeological sites throughout the world. Prehistoric cups were sometimes fashioned from shells and hollowed out stones.
